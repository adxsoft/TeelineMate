# About This App

When I decided to learn Teeline shorthand, a method used by journalists, I couldn't find an app that could help me. As I enjoy building apps I have developed this free app to help me learn Teeline faster.

The app takes any words you enter and displays the Teeline shorthand. You can display the basic Teeline alphabet. Advanced Teeline representatiobs such as indicators, common abbreviations and letter blends are supported and can be enabled and highlighted. 

There are versions of the app for Windows, Mac, Linux and Android. 

A tutorial video is on youtube at https://youtu.be/1FF5jPV6SOM , alternatively search Youtube for "Teeline Mate Video"

The app is developed using the excellent Livecode Community edition and is completely free and open source.

# Installation
## Mac
Unzip latest teelinemate-mac.zip and drag TeelineMate.app to the Applications folder

## Windows
Unzip latest teelinemate-windows.zip and copy TeelineMate.exe to c:/Program Files folder

## Linux
Unzip latest teelinemate-linux.zip and copy TeelineMate binary to /usr/local folder

# Basic Usage
To see the Teeline Alphabet choose the 'Basics' tab at the bottom of the screen and click on 'Show Teeline Alphabet' button. All the Teeline letters will be displayed with their label underneath.

To see a typical sentence choose the "Sample Sentences" dropdown list and select a sentence.

To see your own text rendered as Teeline enter your text at the top of the screen in the blue field. The Teeline will be displayed.

Note.

1. The text has been reduced to shorter words (displayed in the Reduced Text field in brown letters)

2. If you hover over the Teeline you can see which letters are represented

Numbers are not included as they are written as normal and circled in Teeline

# Teeline Indicators

Teeline Indicators are shorter Teeline versions of the normal Teeline letter. For example normal A has two strokes whereas the A Indicator only has one stroke.

Indicators exist for vowels and common word endings such as ing, ent, tion etc.

To see the indicators this app will render go to the 'Advanced' tab and tick the 'Use Indicators' option. Then click the 'Show' button next to the 'Use Indicators' option. All the indicators will be displayed as red Teeline symbols.

If you leave the 'Use Indicators' option checked then indicators will always be shown in the rendered Teeline as red characters 

# Teeline Blends
Teeline Blends are special Teeline symbols that represent two characters. When full words are reduced then certian pairs of characters can be simplified.

For example 'pl' is denoted by placing just a letter p drawn across the ruled line rather than above it. Similarly 'fl' is a letter f across the ruled line. 

To see the blends this app will render go to the 'Advanced' tab and tick the 'Use Blends' option. Then click the 'Show' button next to the 'Use Blends' option. All the blends will be displayed as orange Teeline symbols.

If you leave the 'Use Blends' option checked then blends will always be shown in the rendered Teeline as orange characters 

# Abbreviations
Teeline Abbreviations are one or two letter words that represent a full word.
For example 't' for 'the', 'y' for 'you' etc.

To see the abbreviations this app will render go to the 'Advanced' tab and tick the 'Use Abbreviations' option. Then click the 'Show' button next to the 'Use Abbreviations' option. All the Abbreviations will be displayed.

If you leave the 'Use Abbreviations' option checked then Abbreviations will always be shown in the rendered Teeline.
